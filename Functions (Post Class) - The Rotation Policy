standard input/output: 2s/128000 kB

English Team has now adopted a rotation policy for two of their players: Dom and Leach. On the first day, both of them played but, from the second day onwards, Dom plays every second day, while Leach plays every third day.

For example, on Day 1 - Both, Day 2 - Neither of them, Day 3 - Dom, Day 4 - Leach, Day 5 - Dom, Day 6 - Neither of them, Day 7 - Both.. and so on.

Find the number of days in the interval [A, B] (A and B, both inclusive) when neither Dom played nor Leach.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function RotationPolicy() that takes integers A, and B as arguments.

Constraints:-
1 <= A, B <=100000



code===


static int RotationPolicy(int A, int B){
//Enter your code here
int a=0;
for(int i=A;i<=B;i++){
    if(i%6==2 || i%6==0){
        a++;
    }
}
return a;
}
